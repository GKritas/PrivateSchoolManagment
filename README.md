# Private School Project

This is a console application for a Private School Project. The application is designed to manage information about courses, students, trainers, and assignments, which are related to each other.

## Entities

The application has 4 entities:

- Course: information about courses such as course title, stream, start date, and end date.
- Student: information about students such as first name, last name, date of birth, tuition fees.
- Trainer: information about trainers such as first name, last name, subject.
- Assignment: information about assignments such as title, description, submission date, oral mark, and total mark.

## Main Menu

The application has a main menu that allows the user to register an entity or to see the current entities in the database.

## Show Menu

The show menu provides 9 options to display information about the entities:

- All students: displays information about all students.
- All trainers: displays information about all trainers.
- All assignments: displays information about all assignments.
- All courses: displays information about all courses.
- Students per course: displays a list of students enrolled in a specific course.
- Trainers per course: displays a list of trainers teaching a specific course.
- Assignments per course: displays a list of assignments for a specific course.
- Assignments per student: displays a list of assignments for a specific student.
- Students with more than one assignment: displays the number of students who have more than one assignment.

## Register Menu

The register menu allows the user to register a new entity. The user selects the entity type and enters the required data, such as the student's first name, last name, date of birth, and tuition fees. The user also selects the course and assignment for the student.

## Limitations

This project is not complete, and some validations may not be working correctly, which could cause the program to crash. However, it represents a good attempt at building a decent project for managing a Private School's database.
