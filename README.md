## Private School Project

Its a prompt(console) application.

I made a database that have 4 entities(Course, Student, Trainer, Assignment) that are related with each other.


The app has a main menu that asks the user if he wants to register an entity or if he wants to see the current entities that i passed myself in the Database.java file.

 The show menu has 9 options if the user wants to see all students, all trainers, all assignments, all courses, student per course, trainer per course, assignment per course, assignment per student and how many students have more than 1 assignments.

In the register menu the users selects which entity he wants to make, if he selects student then he need to enter data that the program ask and also he needs to select a course and an assignment in that course.

The project is not complete some validations may not working properly and cause the program to crash. It was my first individual try to make a decent project.
